WordPress API Client
====================
This client software is the reference implementation of an API client for the
[JSON REST API](https://github.com/rmccue/WP-API) and also the independent
testing suite for the API.

The API client library, testing software is [ISC Licensed][license] (similar to
the new BSD license) and depends only on [Requests][], which is bundled with the
client.

(Eventually, this will use Composer instead, and allow using other client
libraries.)
